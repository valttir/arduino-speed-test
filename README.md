# Arduino Speed Test Game (Nopeustesti / Speden Spelit)

This is a reflex game loosely based on the Finnish Nopeustesti.
There are four buttons and four LEDs.
You have to press the right button after the LED lights up.
If you press the wrong button the game ends and you have to restart it with Arduino's reset.
